<h1>Internet</h1>
<p>Internet is a interconnected connection of computers all across the globe.
Internet is basically a connection of webpages.
A website is a collection of webpages.The World Wide Web—usually called the Web for short—is a collection of different websites you can access through the Internet. 
A website is made up of related text, images, and other resources. 
Websites can resemble other forms of media—like newspaper articles or television programs—or they can be interactive in a way that's unique to computers.
the Internet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. 
Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.

When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. 
A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive.
 Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer.
